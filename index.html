  <h2> <strong>Haptic Engineer | Mechatronicist | Experimental Roboticist</strong> </h2>

  <h3> Summary </h3>
  <bodyFont>
    <!-- <p style ="margin-top:45px;"> -->
    <p>
      A self-motivated haptic engineer from a start-up robotics laboratory, with proficiency in fast-prototyping with various actuators/sensors/User Interfaces to investigate human-robot interaction. Seeks to join a research team with a fast-paced, project-driven environment to enhance the mutual perception between humans and robots. In the previous project, proposed a novel paradigm of implementing joint torque as a means to guide a motion and evaluated its performance under various physiological conditions via a frequency -domain analysis and a statistical tool.
    </p>

    <!-- <p> The objective of my research is to understand the characteristics of
      human-robot interaction through haptic information transfer between user and
      robot. It involves not only robot augmenting humans but also identifying
      the properties of the human in the system. <br>
       My current recent research has been focused on learning the user
      perception via physical human-robot-interaction. Using fast-prototyping
      skills, mechatronics, and signal processing experience, I am exploring
      the minimum requirements for users to perceive and how much bandwidth the human
      arm-robot system can handle.
      Based on the physiological/psychological knowledge from human subject testing,
      I aim to expand on understanding more complex robot behavior through human-robot
      interaction. It is currently one way pHRI but my future work is to make it
      smart robot enabling mutual interaction. Under this context, robot should
    model human behavior, which varies per every user. </p> -->

      <!-- <p>  To understand how a new haptic
      feedback device guides a person's joint to a certain angle, I wish to
      develop the idea into the following questions further. 1) When
      people start noticing that the device is providing force to their
      joint, and 2) how sensitive people are to this type of feedback.
      </p> -->

  <h3> Recent Project </h3>

  <div id="grid_body">
    <bodyFont>
      <!-- <p>As pursuing my ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Alan T. Asbeck in Virginia Tech,
        I developed a wearable testbed to understand the human perceptual
        property against kinesthetic sensations (a). The idea behind the project is
        to <b>implement the kinesthetic cue as a haptic information
          transfer to guide/correct arm motion</b>, just like the physical
        therapists aiding patients' vonlutray motion.</p> -->

        <p> My current recent research topic is to evaluate kinesthetic feedback as another type of haptic feedback device.
        Haptic feedback devices are those that convey
        haptic information through the sense of touch. Usually, they consist of
        vibrating motors (like in most cell phones or video game controllers)
        or force-feedback joysticks (where the joystick pushes back on the user).
        Among thoese, kinesthetic feedback is well-known for its ability of intuitive and natural guidance, yet
        appropriate intensity of the kinesthetic input at which the wearer cannot be hindered is still not explored.</p>

        <p>
        I am developing a paradigm of the kinesthetic cue as a means of information transfer in arm motion training without disturbing the wearer.
        In other words, people will move their arm in response to the applied torque, yet the applied torques are too small to disturb the motion.

        To accomplish the goal, I discretize the idea into two study topics: 1)
         when people start noticing that the device is providing force to
         their joint; 2) explore how sensitive trainee is to torque
         feedback in time and frequency domain  to joint torques in terms of
         how fast their arm will move.
        </p>

       <!-- <p>When Dr. Asbeck and I started Assistive Robotics Lab in Fall 2015,
        our high-level goal was to realize a comfortable, light-weight, and low-
        cost wearable device for assisting our daily life. In contrast to the
        full-body-support system, <b>the device only provides partial
          guidance</b> to the user, with a torque smaller than the human
        strength. -->
        <!-- After several prototypes of the exoskeleton, however, we
        realized that it would have been better if there existed any criteria on
        a kinesthetic cue in the scope of haptic delivery to be the guideline
        in designing exoskeleton for motion correction. Thus, handling the
        design problem into the perceptual level, rather than approaching it
        as finding the minimum volume of the actuator or manipulator mechanism,
        would be the first step toward the partial assistance system.  -->

      <p>The new device I made uses a soft sleeve to apply small
      forces to a person's joint<font color="blue"><b>(a)</b></font>. The device should feel like a person gently
      guiding your arm to a certain position. The device subjects wear apply
       forces to the elbow of less than 5% of the maximum force that a typical
       adult male can generate at their elbow.

        Challenges of hardware design here (hardware requirements)
        (torque stiffness and the parasitic torque)

        The test result easily transferable to other exoskeleton design process for the elbow joint.


      Developing a wearable device that requires knowledge of Vector
       Control in motor control ( <font color="blue"><b>(b)</b></font> and  <font color="blue"><b>(c)</b></font>), as well as basic human physiology as how to
       perceive extrinsic kinesthetic stimuli (i.e. joint proprioceptors).</p>

  <h3> Former Project </h3>

  <div id="grid_body">
    <bodyFont>
      <p> During the time of an undergraduate researcher in the NYU Tandon
         Dynamics Systems Laboratory, I worked in the energy
        harvesting team. The major research topic of the team was to examine the electro-
      mechanical transfer functions of smart materials, specifically Piezoelectric and
      Ionic Polymer Metallic Composite (IPMC). </p>
      <p>
      Both IPMCs and Piezoelectric composites share the same property of
      generating electricity when it is deformed and actuating when it is electrified.
      The primary difference is the medium deliveryng those electricity. Unlike the electron charge of the Piezoelectric composite, IPMCs
      requires ions to transfer the electricity, and therefore only functions under ionized water.
      Therefore, setting the proper density of the IPMCs when fabriacting plays the key role and requires much practice to
      make a successful materials.</p>

      <p> All the experimental setup I designed was to investigate/measure the smart materials in oscillatory motion, then to be analyzed in the
        time and frequency domain in terms of transfer functions.
        It includes: 1) underwater base excitation of the Piezoelectric
        composite <font color="blue"><b>(a)</b></font>, 2) underwater biomimetic shark swimming with Piezoelectric
        composite attached <font color="blue"><b>(b)</b></font>, and 3) impedance matching test for IPMCs <font color="blue"><b>(c)</b></font>. </p>

        <p> The data was collected with a Data Acquisition board from National
          Instrument and high-speed camera, then post-processed with
        MATLAB and Mathematica, to be compared with the theoretical model. </p>
