  <h2> <strong>Research Agenda</strong> </h2>

  <h3> Overivew </h3>
  <bodyFont>
    <!-- <p style ="margin-top:45px;"> -->
    <p> The objective of my research is to understand the characteristics of
      human-robot interaction through information transfer between user and
      robot. It involves not only robot augmenting humans but also identifying
      the properties of the human-in-the-loop system. <br>
       My current recent research has been focused on learning the user
      perception via physical human-robot-interaction. Using fast-prototyping
      skills, mechatronics, and signal processing experience, I am exploring
      the minimum requirements for users to perceive and how much bandwidth the human
      arm-robot system can handle.
      Based on the physiological/psychological knowledge from human subject testing,
      I aim to expand on understanding more complex robot behavior through human-robot
      interaction. </p>

  <h3> Current Research </h3>

  <div id="grid_body">
    <bodyFont>
      <p>As pursuing my ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Alan T. Asbeck in Virginia Tech,
        I developed a wearable testbed to understand the human perceptual
        property against kinesthetic sensations (a). The idea behind the project is
        to <b>implement the kinesthetic cue as a haptic information
          transfer to guide/correct arm motion</b>, just like the physical
        therapists aiding patients' vonlutray motion.</p>

       <p>When Dr. Asbeck and I started Assistive Robotics Lab in Fall 2015,
        our high-level goal was to realize a comfortable, light-weight, and low-
        cost wearable device for assisting our daily life. In contrast to the
        full-body-support system, <b>the device only provides partial
          assistance</b> to the user, with a torque smaller than the human
        strength. After several prototypes of the exoskeleton, however, we
        realized that it would have been better if there existed any criteria on
        a kinesthetic cue in the scope of haptic delivery to be the guideline
        in designing exoskeleton for motion correction. Thus, handling the
        design problem into the perceptual level, rather than approaching it
        as finding the minimum volume of the actuator or manipulator mechanism,
        would be the first step toward the partial assistance system. <br>

       Developing a wearable device requires knowledge of Field Oriented
        Control in motor control ((b) and (c)), as well as basic human physiology as how to
        perceive extrinsic kinesthetic stimuli.</p>
      <p> To accomplish the goal, we broken down the project into 1)
        <b>learning psychophysical requirements</b> for the torque
        output; 2) explore the <b>torque stiffness leading to the highest
          bandwidth</b> of the trainee's arm.
        The research has been mainly funded by the Institute for Critical
        Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS) scholarship.

  <h3> Previous Research </h3>

  <div id="grid_body">
    <bodyFont>
      <p> During the time of an undergraduate researcher in the NYU Tandon Dynamics Systems Laboratory under
        Professor Maurizio Porfiri, I worked with Dr. Youngsu Cha in the energy
        harvesting team. </p>
      <p> The major research topic of the team was to examine the electro-
        mechanical property of smart materials, specifically Piezoelectric and
        Ionic Polymer Metallic Composite (IPMC). Along with the fabrication of
        IPMCs, I built test setups for 1) underwater base excitation of the Piezoelectric
        composite (a), 2) underwater biomimetic shark swimming with Piezoelectric
        composite attached (b), and 3) impedance matching test for IPMCs (c).
        The data was collected with a Data
        Acquisition board from National Instrument and post-processed with
        MATLAB and Mathematica, to be compared with the calculated model. </p>
